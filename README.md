# Phreaky Phriday

## Overview
A scalable digital “shared closet” platform empowering women’s communities (starting with sororities) to borrow, lend, and share fashion in a trusted, familiar manner.

## Recruiter TL;DR
* Problem: Fast fashion is unsustainable and inequitable: 8-10% of global emissions, 92M tonnes of waste, 79 trillion liters of water, and systemic labor abuses. Gen Z college women, often driven by social pressures, are the most frequent consumers. Clothing is typically worn only 7-10 times before disposal, fueling a cycle of waste, inequity, and overconsumption.
* Solution: A sorority-based, digital closet that lets members easily upload, borrow, and swap items, prioritizing trust and simple, on-campus swaps.
* Outcome: Promotes sustainability, builds community pride, and saves students money.

## Key features (MVP)
* Registration and login functionality
* User profiles with upload counts, contact info, item listings, wishlists
* Browsing page of item listings with images, descriptions, like functionality with sorting algorithm, filtering system
* Access restrictions by chapter password and email verification
* Event calendar
